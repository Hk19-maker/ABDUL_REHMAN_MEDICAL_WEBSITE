<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>My name is Abdul Rehman and I have always been someone who wants to understand how things work. I am 15 years old and I study at Allied School, a project of the Punjab Group of Colleges. My main subject is computer science, a field that trains my mind to think logically and solve problems step by step. At the same time, biology has become a strong personal interest that continues to grow beyond the classroom.
Biology is not my primary subject, but it feels like a living curiosity. When I read about cells, evolution, or the way the brain controls thought and movement, it feels like discovering hidden systems that keep life functioning. Each topic opens a new window into how the human body and nature are designed with precision and balance.
Computer science gives me structure and clarity. Biology offers depth and mystery. Together, they shape the way I observe the world and think about the future. This book reflects that balance between logic and curiosity. I am not a medical student yet, but I am a learner, and every meaningful journey in science begins with the courage to ask questions</p>
