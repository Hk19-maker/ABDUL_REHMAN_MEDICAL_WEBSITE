<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>Early civilizations worked with limited tools and little knowledge, yet they still tried to heal. Egyptian records show wound cleaning, bone setting and stitching. In India, Sushruta described hundreds of procedures and instruments. Chinese and Mesopotamian healers also left behind early descriptions of treating injuries. These attempts were far from modern standards. There was no understanding of infection or hygiene. Still, these early efforts laid the first stones of surgical knowledge.</p>
