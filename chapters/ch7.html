<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<p>Medical universities follow a structured path. Students begin with foundational sciences such as anatomy, physiology, pathology and biochemistry. They learn how the body works and what changes during disease. Later, they rotate through hospital departments under supervision. They meet patients, learn to communicate clearly and develop professional judgment. Strong academic performance and entrance exams are usually required for admission. </p>
