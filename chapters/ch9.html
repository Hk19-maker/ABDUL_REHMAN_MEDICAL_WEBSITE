<p>First Aid Every Student Should Know
First aid is not surgery. It is about simple steps that protect a person until trained help arrives. Basic first aid includes cleaning minor cuts with clean water, covering wounds with a clean cloth, supporting sprains and applying gentle pressure to slow bleeding. Staying calm and calling for help when needed are the most important steps. First aid prevents a situation from getting worse.</p>
